# Securing Software (CS50 CyberSecurity)

- Hover over links before opening them to see which URL they'll direct you to
- Attacker can show you the name of the link as something credible and whereas they can take you to another URL if you're not careful enough (Always hover over the links to see where you're being taken)
- URL escaping is done by using % (URL encoding)
-**Code Injection**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Writing code in text fields tricking the software into executing code that it's not meant to.
- **Reflected Attack**:  For example you **href'ed** a different URL from the link that a user clicks on and in that different href, there's a javascript code: document.cookie. What will happen is that the cookies of that user will REFLECT back to the URL that the attackers wants to redirect the information to. This can be an attacker hosted web server
