# Spark Big Data

- Spark was introduced to speed up the computational processes. Spark is a framework like Hadoop.
- Spark is seen as a more advanced Hadoop
- Spark process data in chunks "in memory" (RAM) => Up to 100 times faster
- Spark is fast since it executes on RAM

## Spark vs MapReduce


| **Spark**           | **MapReduce**    |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| RAM                 | Disk             |
| Faster              | Slower           |
| Caching             | No caching       |
| Rea time processing | Batch processing |
| Python, java, scala | Java             |

## Architecture of Spark

Following are the components of Spark:

1. **Driver**:
2. **Executors**:
3. **Nodes**:
4. **Cores**
5. **Data Partition**: 
6. **Cluster**:
