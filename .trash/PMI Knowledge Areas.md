# PMI Knowledge Areas

## Software Project Management

A specialized field within project management which focuses on the planning, execution, monitoring, and controlling projects related to software development. It involves application of principles and practices which ensure that the software is developed ==in the defined time==, ==under the set budget==, and of ==desired quality.==

## Knowledge Areas and Process Groups

### Knowledge Areas:
Specific area of expertise and focus that project managers and teams need to consider throughout the project life cycle
Example of Knowledge areas are:
- Project Cost Management
- Project Time Management
- Project Risk Management
- Project Integration Management
- Project Scope Management

### Process Groups:
Refers to the **5** stages that encompasses the entire project life cycle.
Provides a structured framework for managing project activities from start to end

1. Conception and Initiation
2. Definition and Planning
3. Launch and Execution
4. Performance and Control
5. Project Close

## Project Management Triangle

The **Golden Triangle** is a visual aid for project management whose 3 sides represents the core constraints which affect the overall quality of the end product
1. Cost
2. Time
3. Scope

The triangle also represents balance that must be maintained between the triple constraints. If one variable changes, the others would have to too

For successful execution, project managers would have to negotiate a rigid triangle.

### Relationship Between Constraints:
##### Directly Proportional:
- Scope is directly proportional to cost and time.
- If you increase the scope, the cost and time will increase too
##### Inversely Proportional::
- Relationship between cost and time is inversely proportional.
- More time = Less cost
- More cost = Less time

## Scope Creep
- Scope creep is when a project grows beyond its scope. 
- We can also say that project creeps when additional deliverables are included that are not part of the initial project scope
- One of the reasons why scope creeps is because of **gold plating** by developers
## How to Manage Scope Creep?

1. Clearly define project scope
2. Create change control process
3. Document requirements
4. Set requirement priorities
5. Engage stakeholders
6. Regularly review progress
7. Document everything
