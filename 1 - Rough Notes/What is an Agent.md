# What is an Agent

- An agent is an AI model capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with their environment
- Agent has "agency" = Ability to interact with environment

**Formally:**
	 An agent is a system that leverages AI models to interact with it's environment to achieve user-defined objectives. It combines reasoning, planning, and execution of an action to fulfill tasks

_______

An agent has 2 main parts:
1. The Brain (AI Model)
2. The Body (Capabilities and Tools)

**Brain**: This is where the Reasoning and Planning happens. The AI model decides which Actions.
**Body**: This part represents everything the agent is "equipped" to do. It defines the toolset or the environment given to the agent to execute the Actions. The limits of what Actions an agent can do is defined by it's Body.
