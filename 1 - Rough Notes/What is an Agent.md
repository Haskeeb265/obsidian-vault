# What is an Agent

- An agent is an AI model capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with their environment
- Agent has "agency" = Ability to interact with environment

**Formally:**
	 An agent is a system that leverages AI models to interact with it's environment to achieve user-defined objectives. It combines reasoning, planning, and execution of an action to fulfill tasks

_______

An agent has 2 main parts:
1. The Brain (AI Model)
2. The Body (Capabilities and Tools)

**Brain**: This is where the Reasoning and Planning happens. The AI model decides which Actions.
**Body**: This part represents everything the agent is "equipped" to do. It defines the toolset or the environment given to the agent to execute the Actions. The limits of what Actions an agent can do is defined by it's Body.

### The Spectrum of Agency

### Type of AI models We Use for Agents
Most common type of AI model found in Agents are LLMs. They take input as **text** and returns output as **text**.
Most LLMs are capable of returning text only. However some LLMs have **tools** implemented in them which allows them to return output in forms **other than text (image for example)**

___

- An Agent can perform ANY task we implement via **tools** to complete **actions**
	- Let's say your want your Agent to send emails automatically whenever you ask it, for that you'll have to provide the Agent with a function(**tool**) which sends emails.
	- Design of the
