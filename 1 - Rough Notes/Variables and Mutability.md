# Variables and Mutability

- By default, Rust makes your variables immutable. By this we mean that once a value has been assigned to your variable, it cannot be changed.
- Rust encourages you to keep your variables immutable by default because its safe

- Constants and variables are different. You can't use ==mut== with a constant.
- Unlike declaring variables, you use ==const== instead of ==let== 
- Constants naming convention is that their name should be decalred in all caps
- Constants cannot be a return value. It's always set and cannot be changed

- Value of constants are calculated at compile time whereas the values of the variables are calculated at runtime.
