# MD5 Message Digest Algorithm

- MD5 allows us to 128 bit compact outputs are created of messages of variable length.
- MD5 is generally used to create digital signatures, compress large file into more concise ones which can then me encrypted using public and secret keys
- MD5 can also be used to verify signatures and detect tempering in messages. It can also be used to generate and verify 128 bit cryptographic hashes.

However, MD5 has well documented flaws and weaknesses and hence this shouldn't be used for security purposes.

- MD5 was quickly recommended to be replaced by cryptographic functions like SHA-1. This was due to it's early "full collision" report
