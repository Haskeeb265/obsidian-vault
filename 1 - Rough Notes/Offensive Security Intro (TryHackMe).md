# Offensive Security Intro

In offensive security, We simulate the a hacker's actions to find vulnerabilities in a system.

We used "GoBuster". It is a tool used to brute force:
- URIs (directories and files) in web sites.
- DNS subdomains (with wildcard support).
- Virtual Host names on target web servers.
- Open Amazon S3 buckets
- Open Google Cloud buckets
- TFTP servers
