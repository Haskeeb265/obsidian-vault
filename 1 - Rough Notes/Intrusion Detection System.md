# Intrusion Detection System

Intrusion Detection Systems are software or hardware systems that automate the process of monitoring a Computer or a Network to analyze any signs of security problems. Since cyberattacks and malicious intrusions are common now, implementing IDS in security infrastructure has become a necessity.

IDS can be described in terms of three fundamental functional components:
1. **Information Sources:** Used to determine from where the instruction has happened. Host, Network, and Application
2. **Analysis:** Makes sense of the events derived from the information sources. Most common analysis are **misuse detection** and **anomaly detection**
3. **Response:** The set of actions taken when an intrusion is detected.
