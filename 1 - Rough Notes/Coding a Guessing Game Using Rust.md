# Coding a Guessing Game Using Rust

- We start by importing the **io** library from the **std** (standard) library. This helps us in taking input from the user. We start every code by importing such libraries. 
- There are some items like the **io** library which Rust includes in every code. That set of items is called a *prelude*
- If an item that you want to use isn't included in the *prelude*, you'll have to explicitly call it using the ==use== statement
