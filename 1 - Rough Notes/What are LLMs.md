# What are LLMs

- An LLM excels at understanding and generating human language.
- LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data allowing them to learn patterns, structure, and even nuance in language (consists of many millions of parameters)
- Most LLMs nowadays are build on **transformer** architecture based on the **Attention algorithm**.

### TYPES OF TRANSFORMERS:

1. **Encoders**: Takes input from the user and outputs a dense representation of that text. Dense representation = a vector which is for internal understanding where each number in the vector holds a meaning.
2. **Decoders**: Generates a new sequence
