# Securing Accounts (Introduction To Cybersecurity EDX)

## Building Blocks of Security:

1. **Authentication**: Authentication refers to "Who you are". For example, let's say you're Haseeb. Just because you're Haseeb, it doesn't necessarily mean you'd have access to everywhere you go. These are usually IDs, Emails, and Usernames.
2. **Authorization**: Authorization is the process of "Whether you should have access or not". Once a person has authenticated his/her identity, now they would have to give their proof of authorization. This can be anything from passwords to biometrics and so on.

## Some Common Attacks

1. **Dictionary Attack:** A dictionary attack is basically an attacker collecting information on you, storing it into a computer file and then using that file to brute-force your password.
2. **Brute-Force Attacks**: A Brute-Force attack is basically trying all possible combinations in the hope of that one combination will break the password. Passwords of shorter length are more vulnerable to brute-force attack compared to password of longer lengths
