# The Worst can Become the Best

There was a drunk man who was shameless. Around his friends he'd be the one who'd carry his bottle of alcohol in his hands indicating how shameless he was. 

One day a group of people were gathering around a person who was riding on a donkey.

This man was a Iman Ashabi. He was a Muhaddith. Muhaddith is someone who narrates the Hadith of Prophet PBUH

The drunk man asked him to narrate a hadith for him

Iman Ashabi was a man of knowledge and wisdom. He could see the condition of this man. So he narrated a hadith which suited him. Imam Ashabi narrated [this](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6120) Hadith.

The Hadith hit this man straight to his heart and hence he left his past behind and went to another great Iman. Iman Malik Ibn Anas. He was the Imam of Madinah
