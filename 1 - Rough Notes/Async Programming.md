# Async Programming

- **Event Loop**:
Runs and schedules coroutines.
Switch tasks and hit await
Handle callbacks and timeouts and I/O events
Resume tasks when awaited operation finishes
Manages all the coroutines

Asyncio helps us achieve concurrency. Not parallelism

- **Coroutine**:
An async function is called a coroutine
