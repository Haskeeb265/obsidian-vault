There is a lot of information on the internet. Anyone can post anything and claim it to be true. However just because someone posted about something, that doesn't make them an expert or a reputable source.

We should consider the following things when evaluating information:

1. **Source**
2. **Evidence and Reasoning**
3. **Objectivity and Bias**
4. **Corroboration and Consistency**
