I just prayed tahajjud, recited Quran, now I'm sitting at my desk trying to declutter my mind. 

Tomorrow is my FYP mid evaluation. I need to get my figma design done and ready. Last night I went to GoGo's with my appi and bhai. There they made me realize how little time I have left. In 10 days my final semester will be starting. I need to start planning what I need to do from here on.

I've been trying to get my life back together
