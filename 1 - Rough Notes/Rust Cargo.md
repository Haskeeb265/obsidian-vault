# Rust Cargo

Rust Cargo is a package manager and a build tool for your code. It does many tasks like building our code, downloading libraries that our code needs, and building those libraries.

We can create a Cargo project using the following command:
```
cargo new *project-name*
```

The new cargo project generated has an src folder with a *main.rs* file and a *Cargo.toml* file.
