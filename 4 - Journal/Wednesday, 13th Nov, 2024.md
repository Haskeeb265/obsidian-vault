I have been introspecting a lot lately. Trying to figure out my flaws and how to improve myself. I identified most of my flaws but still can't pinpoint the triggers that lead me to them. I want to reach to the root and rip it out so it never happens again.

Mahad has been consistently pressuring me to start praying in Masjid. I've been barely praying let alone praying in Masjid. However last night I made a commitment to him to pray today's Fajr in the Masjid. I did prayed in the Masjid today and not only that but I also prayed Tahajjud, recited Quran, and even did a light workout. 

I'm so proud of myself and so happy how I spent today's morning. I really appreciate the change that I made and I hope I stay consistent and disciplined.

There's a few things in my mind right now. First of all the most urgent is the SPM assignment. Tomorrow is the deadline. At 10:30 I'll be in Uni and once I get back, I'll have to help mama clean the fans. It'll take an hour or two max. Then I'll sit and do the assignment. I also need to manage my attendances from now on. Most of the people won't be coming to university today since yesterday was the last exam of Mid-Term but I'll be going since I want to save my attendance for my sister's wedding. 

There's also this urgency of developing a game or an app looming over my head. I bought the google console play account and I didn't knew that Google would deactivate the account if you stay inactive for too long. I hope to start publishing apps as soon as possible. On top of that I need to completely revamp my digital profiles, resume, and I should start coding my online portfolio.

And then there's K. I feel like my relationship with my parents isn't the best right now. For some reason they still think I'm immature and not ready for anything serious. Till Poma mamo's wedding I'll have to somehow prove to them that I'm mature enough for such stuff. 

That's all for today. So proud of you Haseeb! You did amazing so far. I hope you'll continue the day with the same momentum and drive. InshaaAllah!
