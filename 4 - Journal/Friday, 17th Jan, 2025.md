I'm sitting infront of my computer 30mins before the Jummah. Nowadays I'm feeling a bit anxious because K's father stopped replying and that is probably because of my unsure responses. 

He must be thinking that I'm still not mature enough or maybe I'm not serious enough. That's one part of the coin. The other is that I want to start earning good and (halal) asap so I can approach my parents with more serious case.

Also, I want to tell my F about how her F is coming to Pakistan and I really want both of our parents to meet.

Apart from that I'm feeling anxious because of our FYP. The fact that I SHOULD doing so much more and be productive but then I'm wasting my time. That's not gonna cut it. I need to be more harsh on myself. Self-Love is one thing but so is Self-Destruction. I'm not loving myself when I excuse myself from doing what I should be doing. That's me causing harm to myself. 

For myself and for her. I need to become a better person.
