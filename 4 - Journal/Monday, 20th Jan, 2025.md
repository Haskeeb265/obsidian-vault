I just prayed tahajjud, recited Quran, now I'm sitting at my desk trying to declutter my mind. 

Tomorrow is my FYP mid evaluation. I need to get my figma design done and ready. Last night I went to GoGo's with my appi and bhai. There they made me realize how little time I have left. In 10 days my final semester will be starting. I need to start planning what I need to do from here on.

I've been trying to get my life back together. I'm doing pretty well. I can do better tho. There's always room for improvement. However, just because I can do better, doesn't mean I discredit the progress I've made so far. I'm breaking the momentum of the cycle of doom. Just because I'm not a totally different person overnight doesn't mean I'm not making any progress. The fact that I'm writing this right now is a testimony to the fact that I'm trying to change. 

I miss K so much man. It's in my mind 24/7. It's the reason I'm doing what I'm doing. Otherwise I would've remained the same "boy" without a care or purpose in the world. Just going with the flow of life. But now I have to be conscious and tightly hold the reigns of my life. I have to be incharge. No more autopilot.

Now I'm gonna go back to work. I started uploading on YouTube. Need to pump out 3 shorts vids right now. Then I'll continue working on my Figma.
