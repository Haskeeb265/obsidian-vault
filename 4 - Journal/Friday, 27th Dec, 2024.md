#  Saturday, 28th Dec, 2024

The year is about to end. Even though I thought this would be my year, it didn't turn out to be that. However it did gave me a tons of new experiences.

The best thing 2024 gave me is my K. Was it June or was it July? I don't remember exactly but boy was it one heck of a change. It transformed me into a whole new person. That fact that I made this note on 28 Dec last year and now coming back to finish it at 16th Jan 2025, I saw my 2025 goals in which I had written "Journal daily". Now I know for a fact that I hadn't met K, I would've just read my goal and moved on. But now I came back to finish this before starting another entry.

I got my first taste of corporate life in 2024 as well, I learned how fragile relationships are. This is coming from the fact that how in 3rd Semester two of my classmates got into a relation and now in 7th semester they broke up. I started to be more affectionate towards my mother. Can't say the same for my siblings. I started to be more conscious of my future and my responsibilities. Even though I still suffer with procrastination, all the time at the back of my head there's my thoughts about how to become a better person roaming.

Before 2024 I was pretty much clueless. Going with the flow of life. No purpose whatsoever. Now I have a purpose. Now I know exactly what I need to do.
