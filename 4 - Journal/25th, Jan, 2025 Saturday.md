Today I overheard my mother talking about the people from my village stealing our land. How despite us supporting them for years made them so greedy and evil. My mother is worried about the future. She's worried about how things will be. My father is very inconsistent man. He hates bad people but at the same time couldn't help but still care for them more than his family. 

I once asked him and he said: "Rishtedari jab tak nibha sakho nibhao". That sounds not very sane to me. I would nibha my Rishtedari if the rishtedar isn't an asshole. 

Now I'm more ambitious of learning cybersecurity and being the best at it so I can take matters into my own hands. 

Apart from that, I've started being more consistent with my self-studies. However I feel like my pace is still very slow. That's all.

Yesterday I had a dream about K. I visited HK and she received me. She showed me around and I didn't directly looked at her the whole time. I miss her. I still haven't told abbu about her telling her parents about me and me talking to her father. I don't know why I'm scared when I should be telling him this asap.
