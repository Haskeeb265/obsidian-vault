# Hadoop HDFS

Hadoop is an open source framework which allows us to store and process large amount of data in a parallel and distributed manner. It supports data-intensive distributed applications

**HDFS** and **MapReduce** are two main components of Hadoop. HDFS is the primary data storage system whereas the MapReduce is the processing unit of Hadoop

Hadoop was designed to answer the question:
>**"How to process big data with reasonable cost and time?"**
