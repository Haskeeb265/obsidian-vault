# Search Skills (TryHackMe)

There is a lot of information on the internet. Anyone can post anything and claim it to be true. However just because someone posted about something, that doesn't make them an expert or a reputable source.

We should consider the following things when evaluating information:

1. **Source**: Identify the author
2. **Evidence and Reasoning:** Check if the claims made are backed up by credible and valid evidence
3. **Objectivity and Bias:** See if the information being presented from multiple perspectives or bias?
4. **Corroboration and Consistency:** 

Simply searching for the results that you want on search engines is the bare minimum. If you do that, you still haven't harnessed the full capacity of search engines.

Here are some of the advanced search operators that are allowed on Google:
1. " ": The double quotation allows you to search for the exact phrases that you include in them. For example you might search for "Apple Sauce". This search would return you the pages with that exact phrase in them.
2. site: *site name*: This allows you to limit the search to a certain domain or website. For example you might want to search for Honda Civic on pakwheels.com. you'd search for: ==site: pakwheels.com Honda civic==
3. filetype: This command allows you to search for keywords in the filetype that you want. For example you want to fine PDF's regarding cybersecurity, you'd search: ==filetype: pdf cybersecurity== 


## Special Search Engines:
#### Shodan:

#### Censys:
Censys is similar to Shodan however instead of returning results related to physical devices, it returns results related to open ports, digital certificates, internet assets and internet connected hosts (and more) 
#### Virus Total:
Helps you upload files and run them against several anti viruses to detect any malicious code. All of this happens in a single operation.
#### Have I Been Pwned:
It tells you if your email has appeared in a data breach.
