# Are you a man

A man is not the one who is the biggest and the most intimidating. A man is someone who controls himself in the face of a calamity. 

He is the one who is strong enough to lift his blanket for fajr

There's difference between a man and a boy

Just because you can fight, just because you can lift heavy weights, just because you have more power, that doesn't make you a man. According to society it DOES make you a man. But Allah doesn't care about that. In the eyes of Islam you're not a man. You're not a "**Rajjal**"

How to be a man?

1. Hit all prayers
2. Control anger
3. Be Kind
4. Be generous
5. Have Humility
6. Have empathy
