# Introduction to Information Security

In the digital world, your data and your information is the most valuable asset. Hence that's why it should be your utmost priority to keep it safe and secure from attackers and potential threats. 

Information doesn't need to be secure only when it's **stored**. Rather it should also be kept safe when it's **transmitting and processed**.

Information security is basically protection of **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** of our digital assets. This can be done via the implementation of **technology, policy, education, training, and awareness**.


> [!IMP] According to EC-Council
>> Information Security is in the state of well-being of **information** and **infrastructure** in which possibility of theft, tampering, or disruption of information and services is **kept low** or **tolerable**.

When we talk about **Security** in information security, we use that term in the sense of **minimizing** the **vulnerabilities**.
