# Introduction to Information Security

In the digital world, your data and your information is the most valuable asset. Hence that's why it should be your utmost priority to keep it safe and secure from attackers and potential threats. 

Information doesn't need to be secure only when it's **stored**. Rather it should also be kept safe when it's **transmitting and processed**.

Information security is basically protection of **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** of our digital assets. This can be done via the implementation of **technology, policy, education, training, and awareness**.


> [!IMP] According to EC-Council
>> Information Security is in the state of well-being of **information** and **infrastructure** in which possibility of theft, tampering, or disruption of information and services is **kept low** or **tolerable**.
>
	The above definition implies that it's not possible to 100% remove the threat of an attack from a system

When we talk about **Security** in information security, we use that term in the sense of **minimizing** the **vulnerabilities**. 

Vulnerability is basically ANY weakness that can be **exploited** by an attacker.

Just like information security, Network and Internet security means to **detect, deter, and correct** any flaws in the TRANSMISSION of information.

We need to rely on cyber security because:
1. Evolution of tech
2. Computers involved in too many of our daily tasks
3. More networks = More area to be exploited

Following are the few impacts of the security breaches of your system:
1. Loss of reputation
2. Low client loyalty
3. Low investor confidence
4. Legal action
5. Monetary loss

# Database Security
Another sub domain of Information Security is **Data Security**. It is responsible for the safe keeping of our information. The value of our data motivates the attacker to steal, sabotage, or corrupt it.

*Maintaining CIA triad of our data in the **DBMS** is called Database security.*

Database security can be implemented by with the help of **control approaches**.
These are:
1. Managerial Controls => Policy implementation and Governance. 
2. Physical Controls => Isolating the servers on a room with locked doors and other necessary physical security requirements 
3. Technical Controls => Access control, backup, authentication.

# CIA TRIAD
The CIA Triad is the goals which we need to upheld and look after whenever we're implementing security. Following are the goals that are in CIA triad:
1. **Confidentiality:
2. **Integrity**
3. **Availability**
