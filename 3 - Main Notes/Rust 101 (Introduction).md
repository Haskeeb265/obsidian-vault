# Rust 101 (Introduction)

- Rust is made to *empower*. It fits in all domains.
- Rust is **one of the best** performing programming language out there
- Even though rust can be used everywhere, it's main use cases are:
  - System Programming
  - Graphic Processing
  - Gaming Engines
  - Running Fast and Safe code on browsers
  - Blockchain
  - Cryptography
  - Safety Critical Applications

- Rust is made to guide a dev towards a reliable and safe code
- It helps developers mitigate and traverse through the rough waters of low level programming
- Rust is not made for any single domain. 
- The RUST compiler doesn't run a code with bugs in it. Instead of teams putting efforts in finding out the bugs, they can focus on logic 

## Rust Developer Tools:

1. **Cargo:** An included dependency manager and build tool. It helps with compiling
