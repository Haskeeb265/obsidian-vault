# Big Data Integration

Big data integration is the process of combining, managing, and organizing large volumes of data for analytical purposes. 

Following are the 3 major steps we take for data integration:
1. **Schema Alignment**: Matching or mapping the schemas of data from different sources
2. **Record Linkage**: Identifying records that refer to the same entity across different datasets
3. **Data Fusion**: Combining data from different sources to create a more complete and comprehensible dataset
