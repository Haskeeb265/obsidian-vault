# Project Cost Management

For the cost management process to begin, you first need to have a clarity on what your project scope is, what timelines you've decided, and what deliverables you'll be giving to your client.

**Resource Management** is the first step in project cost management.

**Resources**
1. Staffing
2. Equipment
3. Marketing
4. Training
5. Miscellaneous items

The second step is **Estimation Cost**. In cost estimation you use estimation techniques to predict how much each activity of the project would cost.

The third step of cost management is **Cost Budgeting**. In this step the costs are assigned across the project timeline. Each cost will be incurred only on the time it is blocked to. In this step a document is prepared. A financial documents.

| Cost Baseline                                                                                                                                                               | Project Budget                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time-based project budget. By time-based it means that the cost which was scheduled for a certain time would only be handed to you at that particular stage of the project. | A prediction of what WOULD be the budget of the project |
If for example your project budget is $4 million, the sponsor or the client wouldn't give you those $4 million straight away. He would periodically give you the money when the need of those funds arrive

The **Baseline Cost** is used as a reference point for measuring if the project's progress is Optimal or not.
Basline Cost is basically a reference point to determine if the project is doing good, as intended, or bad? Good = Below the baseline As intended = On the baseline Bad = Over the baseline

#### **EARNED VALUE ANALYSIS:
EVA indicates the value of the project's progress.
It requires 3 elements for its calculation:
1. Planned Value: Budget specified for the work scheduled to be completed 
2. Earned Value: Monetary value of the progress of work that is completed
3. Actual Cost: Actual cost that is spent on the project or a specific work/activity.
