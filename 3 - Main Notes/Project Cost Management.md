# Project Cost Management

For the cost management process to begin, you first need to have a clarity on what your project scope is, what timelines you've decided, and what deliverables you'll be giving to your client.

**Resource Management** is the first step in project cost management.

**Resources**
1. Staffing
2. Equipment
3. Marketing
4. Training
5. Miscellaneous items

The second step is **Estimation Cost**. In cost estimation you use estimation techniques to predict how much each activity of the project would cost.

The third step of cost management is **Cost Budgeting**. In this step the costs are assigned across the project timeline. Each cost will be incurred only on the time it is blocked to. In this step a document is prepared. A financial documents.

| Cost Baseline                                                                                                                                                               | Project Budget                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time-based project budget. By time-based it means that the cost which was scheduled for a certain time would only be handed to you at that particular stage of the project. | A prediction of what WOULD be the budget of the project |
If for example your project budget is $4 million, the sponsor or the client wouldn't give you those $4 million straight away. He would periodically give you the money when the need of those funds arrive

The **Baseline Cost** is used as a reference point for measuring if the project's progress is Optimal or not.
Baseline Cost is basically a reference point to determine if the project is doing good, as intended, or bad? Good = Below the baseline As intended = On the baseline Bad = Over the baseline

#### **EARNED VALUE ANALYSIS:
EVA indicates the value of the project's progress.
It requires 3 elements for its calculation:
1. Planned Value **(PV)**: The amount that the project is SUPPOSED to be completed up to some point. *(Example in source material)* 
2. Earned Value **(EV)** : Monetary value of the progress of work that is completed *(Example in source material)* 
3. Actual Cost **(AC)**: Actual cost that is spent on the project or a specific work/activity.*(Example in source material)*

Following are the analysis that we do with the above 3 elements:
1. **Schedule Variance**: SV tells you how ahead or behind schedule your project is.
   SV = EV - PV
   - If SV is -ve, your project is BEHIND schedule
   - If SV is 0, your project is ON schedule
   - If SV is +ve, your project is AHEAD of schedule
2. **Schedule Performance Index**: SPI tells you how EFFICIENTLY you're using your time.
   SPI = EV / PV
   - If SPI is less than 0, the TASK is BEHIND schedule
   - If SPI is 0, the TASK is on schedule
   - If SPI is greater than 1, the TASK is ahead of schedule.
   - SPI = 0 = Task has not started
   - SPI = 0.5 = Half of the task has been done
   - SPI = 1 = Task on schedule
   - SPI = 2 = Twice the task has been performed then it was suppose to.
> [!NOTE] **SPI vs SV**
> The major difference between SPI and SV is that SPI is a ratio which tells us about the progress of our activities whereas SV tells us in ABSOLUTE how ahead or far we are from our schedule
3. **Cost Variance**: CV tells us how over or under budget the project is
   CV = EV - AC
   - If CV < 0 = Task is over budget
   - If CV = 0 = Task is on budget
   - If CV > 0 = Task is under budget
4. **Cost Performance Index**: CPI tells us how efficiently we're using our resources
   CPI = EV / AC
   - CPI < 0 = Task is over budget
   - CPI = 0 = Task is on budget
   - CPI > 0 = Task is under budget
