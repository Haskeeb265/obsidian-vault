# Advanced Big Data Analytics

Big data is a term referred to the data or information generated everyday that is too big to store and process using the traditional processing and storing methods

Big data analytics can be defined as the process in which we extract meaningful information, insights and patterns from the huge amount of data.

There are 3 types of data of data structures that we encounter in Big data analytics:
1. **Structured Data**: Data that already have a proper structure such as CSV files, spreadsheets, and data tables in databases
2. **Unstructured Data:** Data that does not have any defined structure. This type of data includes media files including images, audio, and video files
3. **Semi-Structured Data:** Does not rely on rigid tables but still have some organizational attributes. This is with the help of tags and markdowns. For example JSON files and HTML files

### Characteristics of Big Data

Big data has 3 important characteristics:
1. **Volume**: The amount of data being generated
2. **Velocity**: The speed at which the data is being generated
3. **Variety:** The different type of data that is being generated

Following are the tools that are used for Big data analytics:
>**MongoDB:** Used for datasets that change frequently
>**Hadoop:** Stores and analyze the *tools* used for big data analytics
>**Talend:** Used for data integration
>**Cassandra:** Distributed database that is used for handling chunks of data
>**Storm:** Real time open source computational system
>**Spark:** Used for real time processing and analysis of large amount of data
