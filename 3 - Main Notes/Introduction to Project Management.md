> A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, result, or service

A project can a product: An app
A project can be a result: Covid Vaccine (Research project)
A project can be a service: Call centers

There are many types of software project life cycles which dictate how to pursue the development of a software product from start to end. Such models are:
- ==Waterfall:==
	Waterfall is a linear and sequential software development. Each phase must be completed before starting the next
- ==V-Model:==
	A software development model which integrates testing of the corresponding activities alongside the development phase
- ==Incremental Model:==
	Development process in which the project is delivered in small functional modules.
- ==Iterative Model:==
	Development approach where the software is built and refined through repeated cycles of development.

| Focuses on specifically on the **development** of the software. | Focuses beyond the technical aspects of the project.            |
| Only deals with technical aspects                               | SPLC includes the **management** aspects of the project as well |
