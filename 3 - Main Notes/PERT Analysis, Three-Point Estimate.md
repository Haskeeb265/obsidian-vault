# PERT Analysis, Three-Point Estimate

A PERT chart is a graphical representation of a project's timeline that shows all the necessary tasks that are needed to be done to complete the project.

## Three-Point Estimate
In this technique we involve people who are professional in the task that we are estimating.

Initially 3 figures are produced to assess the tasks.
1. **Most Likely:**
2. **Pessimistic**:
3. **Optimistic**:
