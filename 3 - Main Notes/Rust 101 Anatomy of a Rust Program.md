# Rust 101 Anatomy of a Rust Program

```
fn main () {
println!("Hello, World")
}
```

- The above code is a simple Hello World code.

Let's break it down:
- the main () function is always the first code block that runs in a Rust program
- we called a Rust **Macro** using the !
- Macros and normal functions behave differently
- In Rust you have to first compile and then run the code (2 steps unlike other dynamic languages). However what's interesting is that you can compile the Rust code, give the compiled file to another person and he/she can run it without having to install Rust on their computer
