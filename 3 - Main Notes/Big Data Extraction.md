# Big Data Extraction

Data extraction is process of getting data from a source for further processing, storage, or analysis. Data is typically *crawled* through to get any information out of it from sources such as databases or documents.

Data extraction basically refers to the process of procuring data from a given source and then moving it to a new context.

#### Extract/Transform/Load (ETL)

- Data extraction is perhaps the most crucial part of ETL. Some even call it the backbone of ETL. ETL is basically a process that that drives the data and analytics workflows.
- ETL allows organizations to bring data from different sources into a single location.

**Extraction**: Gathering data from one or more sources. This process includes locating and identifying relevant data.
**Transformation**: In this stage the data is preprocessed.
**Loading**: The preprocessed data is sent to a central repo for immediate or further analysis
